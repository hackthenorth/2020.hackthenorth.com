## Important information

Your travel option is based on your location in January. We will only provide reimbursements if your dashboard indicates that you are not walking or taking a bus provided by Hack the North.

## Reimbursement policy (only applicable to hackers receiving reimbursements)

If your transportation requires an advanced purchase, **it must be purchased by your RSVP deadline (unless you are required to apply for a visa).** Otherwise, you will not be reimbursed.

- Once you have made your booking, we will not reimburse any changed fees.

In order to receive your reimbursement, you must upload all receipts to your hacker dashboard by:

- **Your RSVP deadline** if you are taking a flight but do not require a visa.
- **January 17, 2021** if you are taking public transit or driving.

Please bring government-issued ID (driver’s license, passport, etc) if you are being reimbursed at Hack the North.

**Note that if you pay for some form of travel, but are not in attendance at Hack the North 2021, you will NOT be reimbursed.**

You should not be using this travel reimbursement as a free ticket to Waterloo. To receive your travel reimbursement, you must be in attendance at Hack the North for the duration of the event. We reserve the right to withhold your reimbursement if evidence exists that you were not present over the majority of the weekend.
